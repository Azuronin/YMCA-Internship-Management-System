I just found my freelancing code through my old desktop!

The Internship Management System (IMS) is a web-based application built using .NET and Entity Framework Core that streamlines the management of internship programs for organizations and educational institutions.
The system centralizes intern records, internship postings, applications, evaluations, and progress tracking into a single, efficient platform.
IMS enables administrators to manage internship listings, assign supervisors, and monitor intern performance, while interns can apply for internships, submit requirements, and track their progress. 
Supervisors can evaluate interns, provide feedback, and manage assigned interns through a structured workflow.
The system follows a layered architecture with a RESTful API backend, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and clean separation of concerns. Entity Framework Core is used for database access, enabling efficient CRUD operations, data validation, and migrations. 
The application emphasizes secure authentication, role-based access control, and reliable data persistence.
